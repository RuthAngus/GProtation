The light curves of spotted, rotating stars are often non-sinusoidal and
Quasi-Periodic (QP) and a strictly periodic sinusoid is therefore not
a representative generative model.
Ideally, a physical model of the stellar surface would be conditioned on the
data, however the parameters of such models can be highly degenerate.
Instead, we use an appropriate {\it effective} model: a Gaussian Process (GP)
with a QP covariance kernel function.
% \begin{equation}
% 	k_{i, j} = A \exp \left[ - \frac{\sin^2(\pi(x_i-x_j)/P)} \
% 	{2g^2}-\frac{(x_i-x_j)^2}{2l^2}\right],
% \end{equation}

By modelling the covariance matrix of the light curve with a QP GP, we remain
agnostic about model choice, whilst sampling directly from the posterior
probability distribution function of the periodic parameter and marginalising
over the other kernel hyperparameters.
We simulated 300 light curves with a range of rotation periods and spot
lifetimes and attempted to recover the rotation periods using three methods:
our GP method, a sine-fitting periodogram method and an AutoCorrelation
Function (ACF) method.
% Function (ACF) method \citep{amy}.
The posterior probability distribution of the rotation period parameter was
sampled using the affine invariant ensemble MCMC sampler, {\tt emcee}
% \footnote{

and the
GP operations were performed using the {\tt george} python package
% \footnote{https://github.com/dfm/george}.
This method produces rotation periods that are more precise than the
periodogram and both more accurate and precise than the ACF method.
Furthermore, the improvement is expected to be even more dramatic when applied
to real, noisy {\it Kepler} light curves, since the GP method is well suited to
modelling rotation signals and correlated noise simultaneously.
